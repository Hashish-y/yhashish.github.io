# Portfolio website

This is source for my personal website, forked from abhiske-mvr developed using Jekyll and deployed using github pages. 
The website was originally designed and developed by [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7/bchiang7.github.io), which abhishek mercilessly forked and edited. If you are interested in web development, make sure to check her page for much more awesome projects.
