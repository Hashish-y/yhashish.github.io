  description: Published in the conference to Solid State Electronics, April 24 2022. We
have carried out a comprehensive study of the gate current(IG) in advanced MOS architectures for different 
gate lengths and cross section areas using an in house simulation tool We have considered only direct tunneling
under the assumption that trap concentration and therefore the trap assisted current would be small in a
matured technology We also investigated the effect of the interfacial(IL) SiO 2 layer on gate current in a high
gate stack Our results suggest that IL leads to an increase in the gate current for equivalent EOT They also
emphasize that decreasing the cross section area results in a significant increase in the IG.
